## Project Notes

### Front end

The front end of this project uses React, React Router, and React Table to display several web pages of information and a table of information about employees. A basic menu structure is at the top which gives access to all pages available to the user. The bottom area of the page is where the content is displayed for each of these web pages.

## API

The employee information is filled into the employee table with data that Axios has gathered using API access of the website: [https://randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me)

## Future Features

Future features that could be added include the ability to create, update, and delete employees; search for employees; testing.
